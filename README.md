# Robotic Arm 

The goal of this project is to create a robotic arm. This exercise is being done to learn more about MicroPython, Raspberry Pi, and robotic programming.

## Description

ADD

## Getting Started

### Background
This code is utilized in two major ways. The first way is using an IDE that is suitable for MicroPython and interacting with a Raspberry Pi. In this case, I used Thonny. In using Thonny, the main.py code can be delivered to the Raspberry Pi, and the CSV file can be retrieved from the Raspberry Pi. The other way is using a "typical"  IDE like VS Code to run the plotting program. 

Thonny Dependencies:
* SSD1306 OLED LCD Library (on board)

Plotting Dependencies:
* Matplotlib
