# Robotic Arm 

The goal of this project is to create a robotic arm. This exercise is being done to learn more about MicroPython, Raspberry Pi, and robotic programming. In building this robotic arm, I utilized CAD, coding, and circuit analysis skills to create a robotic arm.

## Getting Started

### Software Requirements
This code is utilized in **two major ways**. The **first** way is using an IDE that is suitable for MicroPython and interacting with a Raspberry Pi. In this case, I used Thonny. In using Thonny, the main.py code can be delivered to the Raspberry Pi, and the CSV file can be retrieved from the Raspberry Pi. The **second** way is using a "typical"  IDE like VS Code to run the plotting program. 

Thonny Dependencies:
* SSD1306 OLED LCD Library (on board)

Plotting Dependencies:
* Matplotlib

### Hardware Requirements
Access to a 3D printer is required to make this robotic arm. The CAD files will need to be put through a slicer (my favorite is Ultimaker Cura) to be able to be 3D printed. 

* Raspberry Pi Pico W (x1)
* SG-90 Servo Motors (x3)
* PS2 Joystick (x1)
* SSD1306 OLED LCD (x1)
* Breadboard (x1)
